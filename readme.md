# castDog

CastDog is a chromeCast watchdog. It watches the configured chromecasts for changes in the running application. When found that the backdrop is running, it casts the predefined application.

This keeps a standard application running, but also allows you to cast your own content. When you stop casting, CastDog takes over and reinitializes the default application.
